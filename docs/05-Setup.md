## Tips and tricks

### Clear the Chat Session before each exercise

The output of the model is influenced by the contents of the chat session. To ensure that the output of the model is not influenced by previous prompts, click the "Clear Chat" button before entering each new prompt.

### Do this workshop from home

During the workshop we will provide you with an interface to play and explore the OpenAI models. If you want to do it from home you can use [Azure AI Studio](https://ai.azure.com) or [OpenAI Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground), and work through the examples in this repository later at your own pace and schedule.
